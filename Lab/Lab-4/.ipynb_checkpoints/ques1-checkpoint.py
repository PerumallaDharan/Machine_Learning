# Implement Linear Regression and calculate sum of residual error on the following 
# Datasets. 
#     x = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,   9] 
#     y = [1, 3, 2, 5, 7, 8, 8, 9, 10, 12] 
# ï‚·  Compute the regression coefficients using analytic formulation and calculate Sum 
# Squared Error (SSE) and R2 value.
